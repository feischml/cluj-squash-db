1. Season Types 
    a. message handling when duplicate season type entered; for example when season
       is edited and modified, no message appears
    b. when a season type is edited of deleted - message with the fact that this can lead to inconsistent data
       if there are already existent seasons with the given type -> message should appear only when 
       there really is a season created -> check to be implemented
2. Season
    a. link event with season -> event should have a field (not mandatory) linked to season_id and this can be also edited
       and to be shown if an event is part of a season (in the Events menu option)
    b. Manage Ranking of a season -> the season name should appear to be clear for which you are editing the Ranking

3. Events
    a. Manage Ranking of an event -> the event name should appear to be clear for which you are editing the Ranking
    b. Manage events -> if registration is allowed and you modify that it is not allowed afterwards -> there has to
       be a check to see if there are already registered players and if ranking was created. If yes, then message should
       appear that changing settings will conclude in inconsistent data
       -> also when deleting the event and there are registered players, existing rankings
    c. Register until date -> clearly specify the hours until when the registration is possible

4. Manage Users -> role management -> to show which roles are set 

5. Edit My Account -> role management -> to show which roles are set

6. Non Admin
    a. add Seasons menu item -> same as events -> Carousel
    b. under Seasons and Events add the Rankings item
        -> list of seasons and events and when clicking on it, on the rigth the ranking should appear
        -> of course only for the seasons/events which have rankings allowed

7. log-in / log-out with OAUTH

8. show name of the user logged in -> under it: Events Registrations and move the Edit My Account from the People
   option here
   -> in the list of registered events -> also an unregistration should be possible if the registration date is not 
      in the past
   -> if it is in the past, this option should not appear -> also on the events menu item

9. Location implementation -> google maps and coordinates where it is needed

10. Internationalization
